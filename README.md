This repository contains a Python implementation of a spring-mass system. It uses the following equations to model the physical system:

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;F_{spring}=-k(x-x_{eq})">

<img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?&space;F_{friction}=\mu&space;_{k}mg">

This was all done within the vpython module and imported via glowscript to an interactive website.
